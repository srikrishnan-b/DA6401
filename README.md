# DA6401
This repository contains codes written for Assignment 1 of DA6401. 

## Problem statement

In this assignment you need to implement a feedforward neural network and write the backpropagation code for training the network. We strongly recommend using numpy for all matrix/vector operations. You are not allowed to use any automatic differentiation packages. This network will be trained and tested using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Specifically, given an input image (28 x 28 = 784 pixels) from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the network will be trained to classify the image into 1 of 10 classes.
